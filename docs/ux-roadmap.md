# UX Improvement Roadmap

**Overall UX Score: A- (90/100)** - Updated Feb 2026 after Phase 1 completion

**🚀 LAUNCH READY** - All critical UX blockers resolved as of Feb 9, 2026

## User Journey Map

### 1. Onboarding Flow (Grade: A)
**Journey:** Hi -> Name -> Last Name -> Email -> ZIP -> Complete (14-day trial)

**Strengths:**
- Progressive disclosure (one question at a time)
- Flexible input (accepts "John Smith" as full name)
- Clear validation with helpful errors
- Safety valves (HELP, CANCEL, RESTART, SKIP)
- Immediate value (auto-creates first memory, sends VCF)
- Generous 14-day trial with no credit card
- **✅ Clear welcome message explaining value proposition** *(added Feb 2026)*

**Remaining Minor Issues:**
- MODERATE: Skip friction (persuasive text feels pushy)
- MODERATE: No progress indicator shown proactively

### 2. Premium Upgrade Flow (Grade: A-)
**Journey:** UPGRADE -> Pricing display -> PREMIUM/FAMILY -> Stripe link -> Payment -> Activated

**Strengths:**
- Clear pricing (monthly/annual options)
- Stripe Checkout (trusted, secure)
- Immediate premium access
- **✅ Trial expiration warnings (day 7, 1, 0)** *(added Feb 2026)*

**Remaining Minor Issues:**
- MODERATE: Link-only upgrade (no fallback if link fails)
- MODERATE: No mid-trial value reminder (day 7)

### 3. Downgrade/Cancellation Flow (Grade: B)
**Strengths:**
- Data preservation (reminders/memories kept)
- Self-service Stripe Customer Portal
- Clear SMS confirmation
- Cancellation feedback collection (numbered options 1-4 + SKIP) *(added Feb 2026)*
- EXPORT command lets users download data before leaving *(added Feb 2026)*

**Issues:**
- ~~CRITICAL: No exit interview or cancellation feedback~~ DONE (Feb 2026)
- MODERATE: Unclear downgrade impact on existing data
- MODERATE: No win-back attempt after cancellation

### 4. Account Management (Grade: A)
**Strengths:**
- **✅ STATUS command shows account overview** *(added Feb 2026 - PRs #55-58)*
- **✅ Usage counter for free tier** *(added Feb 2026 - PR #53)*
- Trial status visibility with days remaining
- Next billing date for paid users
- Usage stats (reminders, lists, memories)

### PHASE 1: Critical Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED - Feb 2026**

- Day 0: "Your Premium trial has ended. You're now on the free plan (2 reminders/day)."
- Runs daily via Celery Beat at 9 AM UTC
- Tracks sent warnings to avoid duplicates

#### 2. Welcome Message ✅ **DONE** (PR #53)
**Location:** `services/onboarding_service.py:226-233`

**Implementation:**
```
Welcome to Remyndrs! 👋

I'm your AI-powered reminder assistant. I'll help you remember anything—from
daily tasks to important dates.

No app needed - just text me naturally and I'll handle the rest!

Let's get you set up in under a minute. What's your first name?
```

#### 3. Usage Counter for Free Users ✅ **DONE** (PR #53)
**Location:** `services/tier_service.py:372-399`, used in `main.py:3631-3632` and `3761-3762`

**Implementation:**
- Shows "✓ Reminder saved! (1 of 2 today)" after each reminder
- At limit: "⏰ Daily limit reached! Resets at midnight, or text UPGRADE for unlimited."
- Only displays for free tier users
- Automatic counter tracking

### PHASE 2: Value & Visibility ✅ **COMPLETED - Feb 2026**
**Impact: Medium-High | Effort: Medium | Expected: +10% retention**

#### 4. Account Status Command ✅ **DONE** (PRs #55-58)
**Location:** `main.py:2159-2268`
**Keywords:** `STATUS`, `MY ACCOUNT`, `ACCOUNT INFO`, `USAGE`

**Implementation:**
```
📊 Account Status

Plan: Premium (Trial - 7 days left)
Member since: Jan 15, 2024
Next billing: Feb 15, 2024

This Month:
• 12 reminders created today
• 3 of 20 lists
• 8 memories saved

Quick Actions:
• Text ACCOUNT to manage billing
```

**Features:**
- Trial status with days remaining
- Member since date
- Next billing date (paid users)
- Usage stats: reminders (with daily counter for free), lists, memories
- Context-aware quick actions

#### 5. Mid-Trial Value Reminder ⏳ **NOT STARTED**
**Files:** `tasks/reminder_tasks.py` (task exists but value reminder not implemented)

**Planned Implementation:**
```python
# Day 7 of trial:
"You're halfway through your Premium trial!

So far you've created 12 reminders and 2 lists.
After trial: only 2 reminders/day on free plan.

Text UPGRADE to keep unlimited access!"
```

**Priority:** Medium (post-launch optimization)

### PHASE 3: Feedback & Retention
**Impact: Medium | Effort: Low-Medium | Expected: Better product insights**

#### 6. Cancellation Feedback Loop (COMPLETED - Feb 2026)
**Status:** Implemented as part of CS system overhaul. After Stripe cancellation webhook, users receive numbered options (1-4 + SKIP). Responses stored with `[CANCELLATION]` prefix in support tickets. Uses `pending_cancellation_feedback` flag on users table.
**Files modified:** `services/stripe_service.py`, `main.py`, `database.py`, `models/user.py`

#### 7. Win-Back Campaign
**Files:** `tasks/reminder_tasks.py` (30-day task)

```python
# 30 days after cancel:
"Hey! We've missed you at Remyndrs.

Since you left, we've added:
- Improved AI accuracy
- Faster response times
- New list features

Want to come back? Text UPGRADE for 20% off your first month!"
```

### PHASE 4: Polish & Optimization (Ongoing)

#### 8. Conversational Tone Improvements
- Replace robotic language with warm, friendly tone
- Shorten confirmation messages
- Add personality to error messages

#### 9. Progress Indicators
- Show "Step X of 4" in all onboarding prompts
- Add progress confirmation for multi-step workflows
- Clearer action feedback

#### 10. Export Before Delete (PARTIALLY COMPLETED - Feb 2026)
- ~~Offer to email data export before deletion~~ DONE: EXPORT SMS command emails JSON data; DELETE ACCOUNT now suggests "Text EXPORT first"
- 24-hour soft delete with UNDO option
- Clear communication about what gets deleted

---

## Key UX Principles

1. **Proactive Communication:** Warn users before limits, trial expiration, or changes
2. **Visibility:** Show usage stats, account status, and progress clearly
3. **Warmth:** Use friendly, conversational tone
4. **Flexibility:** Provide fallbacks (email links if SMS link fails)
5. **Data Safety:** Always preserve data, offer exports, soft deletes
6. **Feedback Loops:** Ask why users cancel, what features they want
7. **Progressive Enhancement:** Free tier should feel complete, not crippled
8. **Clear Value:** Remind users of benefits, especially before conversion points
