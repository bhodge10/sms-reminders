"""
Context Switching Tests for Remyndrs SMS Service

Tests the pending state reminder feature - when a user has a pending state
(clarification, confirmation, etc.) and sends an unrelated message, the
system should remind them of the pending question.

All tests use ConversationSimulator and mock AI responses.
