Multi-Agent Monitoring System for Remyndrs

A lightweight pipeline for detecting, validating, and tracking issues
in user interactions. Designed for small teams with limited resources.

AGENTS:
=======

Agent 1: Interaction Monitor (interaction_monitor.py)
    Detects anomalies in user SMS interactions using pattern matching.
    - Queries recent logs for: confusion, errors, failures, timezone issues
    - Detects repeated attempts, delivery failures, parsing problems
    - Stores findings in monitoring_issues table
    - Run: python -m agents.interaction_monitor

Agent 2: Issue Validator (issue_validator.py)
    Validates issues and identifies root cause patterns.
    - Filters false positives using rules + optional AI
    - Groups similar issues into patterns
    - Adjusts severity based on context (premium users, repeats)
    - Run: python -m agents.issue_validator

Agent 3: Resolution Tracker (resolution_tracker.py)
    Tracks resolutions and measures system health over time.
    - Marks issues as resolved with resolution type
    - Calculates health score (0-100) based on issue rate
    - Detects regressions (fixed patterns that recur)
    - Generates weekly health reports
    - Run: python -m agents.resolution_tracker

PIPELINE:
=========
Run all three agents in sequence:
    python agents/run_pipeline.py
    python agents/run_pipeline.py --hours 48 --snapshot  # With daily snapshot

Quick runners:
    python agents/run_monitor.py       # Agent 1 only
    python agents/run_validator.py     # Agent 2 only
    python agents/run_tracker.py       # Agent 3 dashboard

Scheduled job (recommended daily):
    python agents/run_pipeline.py --snapshot
